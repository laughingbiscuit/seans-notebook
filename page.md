# Sean's Notebook

![](https://github.com/laughingbiscuit/laughingbiscuit.github.io/raw/master/public/logo-transparent.png)

This is my notebook. I build APIs, drive my campervan and ride my vespa around Europe.

## How it works

I get asked a question or I think of something interesting. I write it up. I publish something very simple to explain the point.

All files I publish will be markdown, shell scripts, plantuml files or links to other repos. This should make everything as generic and reusable as possible.

## Contact

I will add a comments section and arrange a regular meetup for API geeks to debate things!
