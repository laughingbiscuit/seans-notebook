# Sean's Notebook

A place for Sean to store all of his notes as code. To keep things simple, everything should be in markdown, plantuml or a shell script. Assets can then be generated using `pandoc`, `claat`, `plantuml` or other tools. Quality checks can be completed with linting and [codedown](https://github.com/earldouglas/codedown).
